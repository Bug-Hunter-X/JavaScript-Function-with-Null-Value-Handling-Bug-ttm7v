# JavaScript Null Value Handling Bug

This repository demonstrates a common subtle bug in JavaScript related to null value handling during arithmetic operations. The `bug.js` file contains a function (`foo`) that attempts to handle null input values by returning 0.  However, this approach is not entirely robust and may not behave as expected for all input scenarios.  The `bugSolution.js` demonstrates a more robust solution.

## Bug Description

The original code's weakness is that it handles nulls but not undefined values, or other potentially unexpected inputs. This could lead to unexpected behavior or errors in certain contexts.

## Solution

The solution improves on the error handling to account for various input types, including null and undefined values, providing more reliable results.
